1. What is the first step in creating a piece of software? 
    Figuring out the requirements 
    
2. What is the difference in discovering what the client needs and discovering what the software should do?  
    What the client thinks they need may not always be what they need because they may not understand the problem 
    
3. In what sense is a software engineer a generalist rather than a specialist? 
    The software engineer needs to be able to understand the clients problem and how to design a solution. 
    
4. List some techniques the book identifies as useful for determining requirements, and for each, give one reason why that technique might not be effective.  
    1. Structured interview ,the closed ended questions may not reveal important details 
    2. questionnaire, questions cant be in response to a answer because questions are pre planed.
    3.  Videotape cameras, may offend the client.
    4. Unstructured interview, the open ended questions may get too many off topic answers. 
    
5. In what sense are requirements dynamic rather than static?
    Things can happen that change the requirements  
    
6. In your own words, state the difference between functional and nonfunctional requirements. Do you think that there is any such thing as a “nonfunctional” requirement? 
    Functional requirements are what are required to get any function out of the product. Yes there are nonfunctional requirements.  Nonfunctional requirements are more like accessories or finishing touches  
    
7. What is top-down analysis? You may also see this referred to as structured analysis. How is this different than the case study in chapter 11 in the book?  When you take a single complete statement and break it down into components 

8. Prototyping is a very controversial issue. Can you think of some reasons why many software engineers think that prototyping is harmful?   
    if it sends the client the wrong idea it could be. 

9. Teams One and Two both have the responsibility for developing a software requirements specification for a project. Team One has infrequent changes to its requirements specification, while Team Two has very frequent changes to its requirements specification. Which team is doing the better job? Justify your answer. 
That is a trick question team one could have just about got all of the requirements right the fist time or they could not be as observant team 2 could have had its requirements change alot 

10. More software defects are traceable to bad requirements analysis than to any other source. Why do you think this is true?  when i write code give that i have the requirements it will normally meet those requirements but if it was put thorough a use case not in the requirements it might fail.
