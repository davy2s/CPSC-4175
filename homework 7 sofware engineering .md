Chapter 6, Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engineering October 2, 2017 

1.	Where, in the software construction process, should testing occur? Explain your reasoning.

		Through out the development. The earlier you find a bug the easier it is to fix and more time saved. A bug could mean you need to change your plan thus early bug discovery can prevent work from needing to be redone.

2.	Explain the differences and similarities between verification and validation.

		Validation is proof something is true. Verification is the process of obtaining proof. 

3.	Explain the difference between execution-based-testing and non-execution-based-testing.

		Execution-based-testing is running the code with test cases. Non- execution-based-testing is more like hand tracking the code or logic.

4.	Discuss the concept of quality as that word is used in the phrase “software quality assurance.”

		Quality is the level of correctness that the developers put into the software and the includes following the design standards set by the software quality assurance team.

5.	Why should software not be tested by the implementors, and not implemented by the testers? Think of an illustration from your life experience (not necessarily IT related).

		The implementors will try to use it in the way it was designed for tester will try to use it in ways it was not intended.

6.	Explain the difference between correctness proofs and execution testing? Which is “better?” Why?

		Correctness proofs is mathematically proving the logic is true. Execution testing is executing the code with all the test cases. Correctness proofs are better because you may not always be able to test every case.


7.	 Read the article The Coming Software Apocalypse in the PDF directory. Wrote a one paragraph appreciation of the article.

 		At first I was skeptical of this article but it does have some good points. A lot of these things need kept in mind. I see a lot of these problems in other people’s code. I don’ think I have most of these problems with my code anymore most of the time.

8.	 In regard to that article, how do you see your role in addressing the concerns raised in that article? Do you really think that there will be a “software apocalypse?”

 		This is already something I strive for, bug free code. I don’t think it will actually come to a apocalypse.
